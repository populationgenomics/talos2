    // normalise one scatter region of the cohort VCF - this is where the scatter actually happens,
    // reading only the region's blocks through the index. --regions-overlap 0 assigns a record to
    // the shard containing its POS, so a deletion spanning a region boundary is emitted exactly once.
    // region 'all' streams the whole file (pre-sharded inputs, or scatter disabled) and needs no
    // index - tbi is [] on that path, staging nothing.
    // ref_genome here is used to create parsimonious representations
    //
    // Two outputs per shard: the full-width normalised BCF (all samples, only ever read again by the
    // lift-over in AnnotateShard - BCF because it is cheaper to write and re-read than bgzipped text;
    // indexed because bcftools annotate needs an index on both sides when -a is a VCF),
    // and a sites-only VCF (no FORMAT columns) which is what echtvar and bcftools csq actually run on.
    // Both come from the same normalised stream, so records correspond 1:1 by CHROM/POS/REF/ALT.
    // fill-tags runs before the sites are extracted, as AC/AF/AN need the genotypes.
    //
    // The region is cut down to the cohort's pedigree samples before anything else reads it, dropping any
    // allele (-a) and record (-c 1) no remaining sample carries - a dataset-wide callset is annotated, stored
    // and filtered at cohort size. A VCF already holding only pedigree samples is read as-is. Pedigree samples
    // absent from the VCF are a warning (the Python stages tolerate them too), no shared samples at all an error.
    // AC/AF/AN are recalculated by fill-tags below, so describe the cohort, not the source callset.
    //
    // FORMAT/PL is dropped here, at the head of the pipeline: Talos never reads it (GT, GQ, DP, AD
    // and the phasing fields are all it uses) and it is the widest per-sample field, so removing it
    // shrinks every downstream pass and the published shards by roughly a third.
    // The full-width BCF is written once and read once, so it gets the lightest deflate level (-Ob1)
    // with threaded compression - deflate is most of this task's runtime, not norm itself
